## Overview

Collablogation aims to exist as a space for text contents creators to work on and share. It is not merely a blog - it
extends classical experience, allowing users to retain their sense of individuality while inviting them to a space of
collaboration, where they can both seek for and provide feedback or team-up for bigger projects. On top of "classic"
article sections Collablogation provides beta section, when the actual collaboration happens. Depending on permissions
granted by instance owner, users can add inline comments (similar to google docs) or participate in full manner.
